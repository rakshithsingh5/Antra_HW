1. when we attempt to divide a integer variable with zero it will throw an 'DivideByZeroException'. If we use a try-catch block we get a message "Attempted to divide by zero".
2. Dividing a floating-point value by zero doesn't throw an exception; it results in positive infinity, negative infinity, or not a number (NaN).
3. In a checked context, a exception is thrown "System.OverflowException".
   In an unchecked context, that is when a value exceeds the max value it will wraps and become negative.
4.'y++' value is assigned first and then is incremented and '++y' y is incremented first and then assignment happen.
5.break exits from the loop, continue skip the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration, return exits from the entire method and return to the caller method.
6. the main three parts of for loop are:
    1. Intialization: it is done in the first segment of for loop
    2. Condition: During every iteration, for loop checks the condition if its true or false('i<10')
    3. Itertion: this statement updates the loop control variable. it is executed at the end.
7. '=' is assignment operator to assign values to the variable and '==' is Equality operator which compares two values for equality.
8. Yes, above statement compiles but it goes into infinite loop.
9.It represents a default case.
10. To be enumerated over by using the `foreach` statement, an object must implement the `IEnumerable` or `IEnumerable<T>` interface.
